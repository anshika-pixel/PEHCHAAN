This project is aimed to identify the person whose voice sample has been given to the model.
we were inspired to create this project during the covid times. During Covid times we had online classes where cameras where switched off in order to avoid 
disturbances in the class, due to this many people were able to fake other peoples attendance. Thus, using our project we would be able to identify the person talking
and if anyone tries to mark proxy for anyone else they could be easily identified.

In this project, we are mainly focused on implementing MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient) and GMM(Gaussian Mixture Model) in pair to achieve our target. 
The dataset used is prepared by using the audio samples collected from youtube in fields like sports personalities, celebrities and famous youtubers.
